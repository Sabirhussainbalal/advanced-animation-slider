# Advanced Animation Slider

An upgraded, more modern version of the [Simple Animation Slider](https://github.com/Sabirhussainbalal/simple-animation-slider). This project adds a dynamic blurred background, motivational Rumi quotes, and smoother transitions for an enhanced user experience.

## Features

- **Dynamic Background:** The entire page background changes with each slide.
- **Overlayed Rumi Quotes:** Each image displays a short quote in a semi-transparent box.
- **Wrap-Around Logic:** Slides loop seamlessly from the last image back to the first (and vice versa).
- **Responsive Design:** Tailwind CSS ensures the slider adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Smooth Transitions & Blur Effects:** A refined transition approach for both active and adjacent slides.
